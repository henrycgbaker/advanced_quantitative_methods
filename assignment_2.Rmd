## Data Preprocessing 

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}

Wage_Gap_df <- read.csv('Gender_Gap_original.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',') %>%
  rename(Country = LOCATION, Employee_status = SUBJECT, Year = TIME, Wage_Gap = Value)%>%
  select(Country, Employee_status, Year, Wage_Gap)%>%
  mutate(Employee_status = as.factor(Employee_status))

Wage_Gap_df$Country <- countrycode(Wage_Gap_df$Country, origin = 'iso3c', destination = 'country.name', nomatch = NULL)

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
